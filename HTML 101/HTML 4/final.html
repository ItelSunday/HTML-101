                    <p>This is the body section of our blog post. In this section I will write about things. I'll be sure to use the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Languange">HTML</abbr> tags I've been learning how to code.</p>
                    <p>This is<span class="danger-text">another paragraph</span>, and I would like to quote the late, great Martin Luther King Jr. who once said <q>I have a dream</q>.</p>

                    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther">
                        <p>You wonder I did not tell you of them. But I did not wish to have them widely circulated.</p>
                       
                        <p>I only intended submitting them to a few learned men for examination, and if they disapproved of them, to suppress them—or make them known through their publications, in the event of their meeting with your approval.</p>
                       
                        <p>But now they are being spread abroad and translated everywhere, which I never could have credited, so that I regret having given birth to them—not that I am unwilling to proclaim the truth manfully, for there is nothing I more ardently desire, but because this way of instructing the people is of little avail.</p>
                       
                        <p>As yet I am still uncertain as to some points, and would have gone into others more particularly, leaving some out entirely, had I foreseen all this.</p>
